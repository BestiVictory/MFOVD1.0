# MFOVD1.0
In film art, the usage of various fields of view in a movie reflects the shooting style of the director or artist. Analyzing which field of view was used by the shot can help us achieve the semi-automatic design and generation of the storyboard. Currently,although there are a growing number of image datasets for aesthetic metrics, text-to-image generation and emotional metrics, datasets of cinematographic footage exclusively are extremely rare. So, we build a dataset named Movie Field of View Dataset
(MFOVD1.0) including 21541 images. Our dataset covers excellent films of different eras at home and abroad, as well as winning films of well-known film awards such as the Oscars. Our work is to capture footage from the original films of these films, and classify these shots into five categories: long shot, full shot, medium shot, close and big close-up.
